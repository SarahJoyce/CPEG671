# Lab 6 Questions - Sarah Joyce
1. For lab6-1.asm, explain what system calls you used and describe how you chained them together to accomplish your goal.
	- I used three system calls: create, open, and write in that order. At first I struggled with understanding how calls work and how I could push multiple strings to the stack for this program, since I needed access to the string "/tmp/hello.txt" for both create and open, and the string "Hello World!\n" for write. Since the string "Hello World!\n" was the last string I needed, I push it to the stack first with a call to a function pushcontent1. Since I then needed to put the string "/tmp/hello.txt" twice on the stack, I simply pushed that string to the stack with another call to pushcontent2. That function pushcontent2 pushes "/tmp/hello.txt" again and calls func, which is the main content of the program. Then in func I simply followed the pattern of putting the system call number into eax and the other parameters needed into the other registers, and popping to a register when I needed one of the strings from the stack.
	
2. Suppose your shellcode was injected via scanf. What bytes would you have to eliminate from your shellcode to ensure it gets injected properly?
	- The characters 0x9 (horizontal tab), 0xA (new line) and 0x20 (space) are not allowed in scanf. However, when I checked my code for part 2b, it already does not contain any of those bytes, so that code will run in both strcpy and scanf.
