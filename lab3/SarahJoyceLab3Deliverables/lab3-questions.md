# Lab 3 Questions - Sarah Joyce
1. What is the correct password for lab3-1? Describe how the program generates this password.
	- The password is ^BK^]KYOKYS. This string is generated by performing a bitwise XOR on each character in the string "thatwaseasy." The program performs the XOR operations on the ASCII values of the characters in the string with the hexadecimal number 0x2a.
2. What is the correct password for lab3-2? Describe how the program generates this password.
	- The password is YSAESAWTAHT. This string is generated first by reversing the string "thatwaseasy" and then by subtracting the hexadecimal number 0x20 from the ASCII values of each of the characters.
3. For lab3-1, what is the purpose of the local variable located at `ebp-0x20`?
	- The local variable at ebp-0x20 is later assigned to zero and used as a counter variable in a for loop.
4. For lab3-2, what does the instruction `lea ecx, [eax - 0x20]` do, and why is it significant for this binary?
	- This instruction takes what is currently in the register eax, subtracts the hexadecimal number 0x20 from it, and saves it in the register ecx. In this line of the binary, the data in eax is a lowercase character. Subtracting 0x20 from the lowercase character literally subtracts 0x20 from the ASCII value of the lowercase character, which gives us the uppercase of the same character.
