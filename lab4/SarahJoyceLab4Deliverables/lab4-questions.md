#Lab 4 Questions - Sarah Joyce
1. What is the expected password? Describe how this password is generated by the program.
	- The expected password is 6 integers: 4 8 15 16 23 42. These numbers are generated through a function called encrypt that calls a series of mathematical instructions such as add, sub, xor, and not. The program compares the "encrypted" value of the correct password with the "encrypted" value of the input.
2. EXTRA CREDIT: What non-primitive data structure is being used in this program? How do you know this? HINT: 'array' is not the correct answer.
	- Is it a linked list?
3. What is the inverse of the following operations: XOR, NOT, ADD, SUB?
	- To inverse XOR and NOT, you perform them again on the value. The inverse of ADD is SUB and the inverse of SUB is ADD.
4. What is the purpose of the local variable located at `ebp - local_34h`?
	- This variable is a boolean that is initialized to 1. If it is set to 0 after the comparison block, it indicates that the input is not equal to the correct password and the program returns "Incorrect."
5. What does the use of `malloc` indicate about the memory location of a given variable?
	- The use of malloc indicates that the variable has been allocated memory somewhere on the heap, not on the stack.
